                <p><strong>Documented Reality:</strong> Trump received at least $60.7 million in loans from his father, most of which were never fully repaid. Additionally, he received:</p>
                <ul style="margin-top: 10px; margin-left: 20px;">

                <p>By age 3, Trump was earning $200,000 a year (in today's dollars) from his father's empire. By age 8, he was a millionaire. By the time he graduated college, his father had set him up with a trust fund and multiple income streams.</p>

                    <li><strong>Depreciation:</strong> Trump could deduct the declining value of his buildings and properties, even as they appreciated in real market value.</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Expense Deductions:</strong> Deducted $70,000+ for hairstyling during The Apprentice, consulting fees (some paid to his own children), and other personal expenses as business costs.</li>

                <h3>1. Estate Tax Avoidance (1990s-2000s)</h3>
                <p><strong>The System:</strong> Using GRATs (Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts) and other vehicles to transfer wealth while avoiding estate taxes</p>
                <p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The NYT investigation found Fred and Donald Trump used schemes to undervalue properties and create shell companies to avoid over $500 million in gift and estate taxes.</p>
                <p><strong>Legal Status:</strong> NYT described patterns that "appear to have been improper" and in some cases "outright fraud." Statute of limitations prevented prosecution.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="fact-item">
                <h3>2. Real Estate Tax Benefits</h3>
                <p><strong>The System:</strong> Real estate investors get special tax treatment including:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">
                    <li>Depreciation deductions (even when property values rise)</li>
                    <li>1031 exchanges (selling property tax-free if you buy another)</li>
                    <li>Passive activity loss rules (different treatment than regular income)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Why It Exists:</strong> Lobbying by real estate industry; justified as encouraging development and housing investment</p>
                <p><strong>Who Benefits:</strong> Primarily wealthy real estate investors; average homeowners get minimal benefit</p>

                <h3>3. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</h3>
                <p><strong>What Trump Signed:</strong> Major tax overhaul that:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">
                    <li>Cut corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%</li>
                    <li>Kept lower capital gains rates (15-20% vs. up to 37% for wages)</li>
                    <li>Created 20% deduction for "pass-through" business income (LLCs, S-corps)</li>
                    <li>Doubled estate tax exemption to $11.2 million per person</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Personal Benefit:</strong> Analysis suggested Trump personally could save $10-15 million annually from the law. His children would save hundreds of millions in estate taxes.</p>

                    <li>Studies show minimal "trickle down" effect from tax cuts for the wealthy</li>
                    <li>Between 1980-2020, top 1% wealth increased 300%, while median wages stagnated</li>
                    <li>Corporate tax cuts in 2017 led primarily to stock buybacks, not worker raises or new jobs</li>
                    <li>Estate tax only affects 0.1% of estates (only those worth $12+ million), yet is constantly targeted for cuts</li>

                <h3>Trump's Specific Case</h3>
                <p>Trump inherited a real estate empire, got bailed out by his father multiple times, used bankruptcy to shield himself from business losses, paid minimal taxes using accounting strategies, then as president signed into law tax cuts that personally benefited him and his heirs by millions.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>The Protection Systems:</strong></p>

                    <li>Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs) - Trump has used over 500 LLCs to shield personal assets</li>
                    <li>Corporate bankruptcy laws - Allow companies to fail while owners keep personal wealth</li>
                    <li>Trust structures - Protect inherited wealth from taxation and creditors</li>
                    <li>Real estate valuation rules - Allow claiming properties are worth less for tax purposes, more for loans</li>

                <p>Trump's wealth story is not one of business genius, but of generational wealth transfer, legal tax avoidance structures available only to the very wealthy, corporate protections that shield personal assets, and policy decisions that benefit the ultra-rich. The system is designed to protect accumulated wealth, not reward business acumen or hard work.</p>
